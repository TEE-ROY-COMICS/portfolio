				<h4>In a nutshell</h4>
				<p>
					DAS (Detect weak points, Analyze risks, Secure the system) is a software application developed for the cyber security firm MailbornWolff by "Das Hexagon", a team comprised of six computer science students and one communication design student (me) from Hochschule Mannheim, as part of the SEP (software engineering project).
				</p>

					<h4>Background</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="size-2">
				<p>
					MaibornWolff is a globally operating IT firm with a wide spectrum of specialities all centering around software engineering and IT-consulting, which include IT- and agile consulting, software-, web- and mobile engineering as well as test management, cyber security, design thinking, digital transformation consulting and -engineering, salesforce, IoT, Blockchain, DevOps, cloud-native development, machine learning, XR and UCD.
				</p>
				<p>
					The cybersecurity field of MailbornWolff advises and creates risk analyses of customer's IT system architecture.
					These advisors lose a lot of time because of the effort to create a new risk analysis from scratch in Excel for every customer.
					That’s why MailbornWolff needs a software, that simplifies  the whole process.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="size-1">
				<h4>Problem</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="size-2">
				<p>
					So the request to us was a web program that let you easily visualize a customer's IT system architecture with icons that should be able to be connected and edited with different parameters and values. Several other must-have and can-have features were listed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Due to this specific case, the usual research phase of UX design has been altered.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="size-3">
				<h1>Process</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="size-1">
				<h4>Analysis and research</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="size-2">
				<p>
					First of all, we had to understand the whole risk analysis process. This happened after lectures by MailbornWolff and summaries and analyses of the learned.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then I specifically planned out the UX and regular design through analyses of competing programs already on the market. I studied their design, UX and noted down pros and cons of the respective program.
				</p>
				<p>
					I even looked at Super Mario Maker because the firm proposed a drag and drop bar for the icons.

				<h4>Unique Selling Point</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="size-2">
				<p>
				Our unique selling point is the inclusion of the "4x6-Methode", a method specifically developed by the company that consists of 6 potential points of attacks and 4 types of attackers.

			<div class="size-1">
				<h4>User Story Map</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="size-2">
				<p>
				After all the lectures by MailbornWolff we defined a user story map that covers all necessary functions and features of the needed program. Due to the growing complexity, this took several tries to finally nail and truthfully understand.

				<h4>Design Sketches</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="size-2">
				<p>
				The first sketches of the surface and interface used drag and drop bars to place the icons on the canvas. This was later removed in favor of a radial menu.

				<h4>Prototyping</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="size-2">
				<p>
				The design process started out with prototyping on Figma.
				The overall design is kept in a simple, minimalistic but still easy to understand way that also follows MailbornWolff’s corporate design.
				</p>
				<p>
				All interactive elements are rounded and/or grayish to distinguish themselves from the black and sharp non-interactive elements.</p>
				<p>
				The growing complexity of the whole program with the steady feedback through tests led to ever-changing pages throughout the whole designing phase.

				<h4>Retrospective</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="size-2">
				<p>
				The biggest thing I’ve learned through this experience was how it would be to work with computer scientists as a single designer. Truly a humbling and educational experience.
				Other useful things were bringing my Figma skills to a whole new level, finding out about useful websites like getbootstrap.com and of course working with a big client.
